###C code designed to create a container with specified cpu, mem usage.

A container is a virtual machine look alike. It is not a machine itself, it is a part of the host. The container has its own resources or partitions of the resources. It also has its own file system, network config, memory and cpu slices. A container may run Ubuntu or an Alpine Linux system.
